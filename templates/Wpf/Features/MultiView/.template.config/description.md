Help your users be more productive by letting them view independent parts of your app in separate windows. When you create multiple windows for an app, each window behaves independently. The taskbar shows each window separately. Users can move, resize, show, and hide app windows independently and can switch between app windows as if they were separate apps. Each window operates in its own thread.
