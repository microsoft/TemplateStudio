MSTest is Microsoft's suite of unit testing tools. The unit testing framework is defined in Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework.dll. Unit tests created with the unit testing framework can be executed in Visual Studio or, using MSTest.exe, from a command line.

Including this feature adds a new project to the solution that is set up for hosting Unit tests of the code in the main app.
