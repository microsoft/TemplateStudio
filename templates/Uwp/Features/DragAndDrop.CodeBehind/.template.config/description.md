Drag and drop is a classic, natural way of interacting with content such as images and files. Once implemented, drag and drop works seamlessly in all directions, including app-to-app, app-to-desktop, and desktop-to app.

The Drag & Drop feature provides a wrapper service over the [standard UWP drag and drop functionallity](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/drag-and-drop) to simplify the required code to create drag and drop ready apps as well as follows the framework pattern used by your app.
