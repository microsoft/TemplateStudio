# Test the App project with nUnit

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from JUnit, the current production release, version 3, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of .NET platforms.

Including this feature adds a new project to the solution that is set up for hosting Unit tests of the code in the Core library.
