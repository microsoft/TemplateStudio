# Win App Driver

Windows Application Driver is a service to support Selenium-like UI Test Automation on Windows Applications. This service supports testing **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)** and **Classic Windows (Win32)** apps on Windows 10 PCs.

Including this feature adds a new project to the solution that is set up for hosting UI tests of your WPF app that are powered by WinAppDriver.
