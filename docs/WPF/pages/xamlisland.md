# XAML Island page

This page includes a CustomUserControl using a **WindowsXamlHost** control from the **Windows Community Toolkit** to host a UWP control.

This page adds two projects to the solution:

- A **UWP library** that will hosts the UWP Control that will be rendered in the WPF app.
- A **UWP app project** that is necessary to host UWP controls with XAML Island and will never be displayed.

You can read more about [hosting a custom UWP control in a WPF app using XAML Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands).
