# Share Target

ShareTarget allows you to easily receive data shared by other apps, such as:

- Link
- Bitmap
- Html
- Rtf text
- Text
- StorageItem

It consists of an ActivationHandler, in charge of activating the app when content is sent and an extension class that provides you with methods to extract the content received.

Additionally we added in a sample page that show's how the app can receive a link or images shared by another app through the share contract.

For more info about receiving data from other apps, consult [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-to-app/receive-data)
