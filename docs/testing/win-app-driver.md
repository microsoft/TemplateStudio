# Win App Driver

Windows Application Driver is a service to support Selenium-like UI Test Automation on Windows Applications. This service supports testing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Classic Windows (Win32) apps on Windows 10 PCs.

Including this feature adds a new project to the solution that is set up for hosting UI tests of your UWP app that are powered by WinAppDriver.
