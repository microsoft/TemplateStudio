# Test Core library with nUnit

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from JUnit, the current production release, version 3, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of .NET platforms.

Including this feature adds a new project to the solution that is set up for hosting Unit tests of the code in the Core library.

An option for using nUnit is only included for the Core library as nUnit does not support testing UWP apps directly.
