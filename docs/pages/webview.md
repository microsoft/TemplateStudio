# Web View

The web view page embeds a view into your app that renders web content using the Microsoft Edge rendering engine. Hyperlinks can also appear and function in a web view control.  You can use a web view control to display richly formatted HTML content from a remote web server, dynamically generated code, or content files in your app package. Rich content can also contain script code and communicate between the script and your app's code.
