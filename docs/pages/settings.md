# Settings Page

By default the settings page contains a single boolean setting to track whether the app should be displayed with the Light or Dark theme.

You can add additional settings by following the instructions appropraite to the framework you are using:

[Code Behind](./settings-codebehind.md)

[MVVM Basic](./settings-mvvmbasic.md)

[MVVM Light](./settings-mvvmlight.md)
