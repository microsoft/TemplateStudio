The web view page embeds a WebView2 control into your app that renders web content using the Microsoft Edge with Chromium rendering engine.

You can use the WebView2 control in the page to display richly formatted HTML content from a remote web server, dynamically generated code, or content files in your app package. Rich content can also contain script code and communicate between the script and your app's code.
