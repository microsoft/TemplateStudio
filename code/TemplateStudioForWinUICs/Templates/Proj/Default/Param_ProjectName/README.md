## Getting Started
Browse and address `TODO:` comments in `View -> Task List` to learn the codebase and understand next steps for turning template code into production code.

Relaunch Template Studio to modify the project by right-clicking on the Project in Solution Explorer then selecting `Add -> New Item (Template Studio)`.

## Publishing
For projects with MSIX packaging, right-click on the application project and select `Package and Publish -> Create App Packages...` to create an MSIX package.

For projects without MSIX packaging, follow the [deployment guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps ) or add the Self-Contained Deployment Feature to enable xcopy deployment.
