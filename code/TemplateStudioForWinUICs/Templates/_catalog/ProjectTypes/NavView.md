This project includes a navigation pane (or 'hamburger menu') at the side of the screen, for navigation between pages.

This style is popular in mobile apps but also works well on larger screens. The menu can be hidden when space is limited, or it isn't needed.

The menu shows items with an icon and text. The menu can be entirely hidden, show just the icon, or show the icon and text. The user can choose to display the full menu at the touch of a button. The menu also adapts automatically to the size of the screen.
