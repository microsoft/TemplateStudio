# Introduction 
Template Studio goal is to help developers with their File->New experience in Visual Studio.  It will generate a strong, generic foundation with the pages you need, but also integrate game changing features like Cortana, action center and background tasks from the start.  Any critical features will have code comments with links to MSDN, stack overflow and blogs to help unblock developers. Once the template is generated for the developer, it can provide base sample data and will be able to compile then run without issue.
